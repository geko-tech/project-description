## First steps

> Tip: If you have a problem or idea, you can create an issue

1) Download last available version from GitHub releases

2) Try to open application

> Tip: A system dialog may appear stating that the "GekoDesktop" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software. In this case, open System Preferences -> Privacy and Security -> scroll down to 'GekoDesktop was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.' -> Tap `Open Anyway`.

3) Move application to `Applications` folder

> Important: If you do NOT move the application to /Applications, but leave it in the /Downloads folder, it will not be able to update.

4) Reopen application from `Applications` folder

## Downloading a specific version

5) Select the required version by tag from Github Releases

6) move to step 2

> Tip: You can also view all available versions in the Settings section of the application and install the one you need.
